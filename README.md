# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation for Online Retail using K-Means Clustering

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was completed as part of a mentor-led internship offered by **Snapdeal** in collaboration with **MentorMind**. The goal was to apply unsupervised learning techniques—specifically **K-Means Clustering**—to identify distinct customer segments for an online retail business.

## 🧠 Objective
To analyze customer purchase behavior and segment customers into meaningful clusters, helping businesses personalize marketing strategies and enhance customer experience.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
